Hello,

I remember you said I can be honest. So the first task wasn't too hard, got it at first 10-20min (at least core) got stuck for another 20 min figuring out why my function don't return the same value as on any random webpage degree calculator until realized that I forgot to add minutes to hour arrow (you got me there). But the biggest catch was the task picture you gave of the branch class, it took me the most time of all tasks until I realized that the list is not initialized,  figured out recursion faster than this.
Anyhow, enjoyed this, and hope to hear from you soon :)
